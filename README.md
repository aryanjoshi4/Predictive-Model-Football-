  Gamble responsibly
  
  Using data from the last ~4 years this program tries to predict how many yards Josh Allen (the current QB1 for the Buffalo Bills) will get 
  depending on what team they are playing.
  
  The program is set to provide the yards against the patriots by default, to see any other team look 
  for the abbreviated name, and replace "pats" on line 63 of "josh.py" with whichever team you wish to see. 

  Abbreviated Names:
    jets, pats, lions, rams, niners, chiefs, colts, dolphins, hawks, titans, texans, ravens, jags, cardinals, raiders, chargers, bengals, 
    eagles, commanders, broncos, cowboys, giants, bucs, ravens, vikings, packers, steelers, browns, bears, saints, falcons.
